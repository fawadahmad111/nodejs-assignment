Here are the steps to take in order to complete the assignment. (read carefully)


Note: Your job in this assignment is to complete the simple note-app.
You do this by adding the functionality of read() and remove() methods.
Additionally, we ask you to add your code in those areas that is commented as \*--code--*\. 
Do not use any additional module.


In this assignment, we assume that Node.js and npm is already installed and working on your computer.


step 1. Install git on your machine (skip the first step if git is already installed on your machine)  

Open the link below to download the git: https://git-scm.com/downloads

step 2. Copy the GitHub repository that was created for the first week's tutorial: 
You do this by running the following command in the command prompt.

   git clone https://github.com/kadeeraziz/class2021

step 3. Go to the class2021 folder.

step 4. Install the Node.js dependencies by running the following command:

     npm update


step 5. Go to the note-app folder, open app.js and note.js.
Read carefully the following commented line in the app.js and note.js for what you have to do. 

    /* --Instruction--

        1. Open a file
        2. ...
        3. ..
    */  

    
After reading the instructions, write your code in those places that is commented as follow:

     /* --Code--

     */  


step 4. After testing your code and making sure that it does what exactly it should do. Zip your app.js and note.js and submit through Google classroom.

step 5. (optional, bonus point) If you are already familiar with GitHub, then create a repository and push your files in that repository. The only thing you have to do in this case is just send us the link for your GitHub repo.

Here is a video tutorial for creating a repo in the GitHub and pushing your code.
